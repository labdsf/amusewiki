We tried to rebuild all the files from april 2017 up to today in the
sites where nocoverpage is set to true (which was too aggressive and
basically always prevented a proper coverpage when it was supposed to
do so only if the table of contents was missing). This failed
(probably this is a multistep upgrade). You are suggested to initiate
a full site rebuild from the admin console.
